feat: Improve ITAD plain ID matching and subscription status accuracy

This commit introduces several improvements to the integration with the IsThereAnyDeal (ITAD) API to enhance the accuracy of game plain ID matching and subscription status reporting:

- **Refactored SteamWishlistItem.PlainIds:** Changed `PlainId` to `PlainIds` (List<string>) to support multiple ITAD plain IDs per game, addressing initial build errors and allowing for more comprehensive subscription checks.
- **Enabled ITAD Title Deserialization:** Added `[JsonPropertyName("title")]` to `ItadGameLookupItem.Title` to correctly deserialize game titles from the ITAD API, resolving issues where titles were appearing as empty.
- **Enhanced Fuzzy Matching Logic:** Overhauled `GetPlainIdsAsync` to implement a robust scoring mechanism for matching Steam game titles with ITAD entries. This logic now:
    - Calculates a score for each potential ITAD match based on exactness, prefix matching (for editions), and contains-based matching.
    - Filters out non-game content (e.g., currency packs, soundtracks, DLC) when selecting edition-based matches to prevent false positives.
    - Returns all ITAD plain IDs that achieve a score of 50 or higher, ensuring that all relevant editions or versions of a game are considered for subscription status, without increasing the number of ITAD API calls for subscription checks.

These changes resolve issues where games were incorrectly flagged as being on or off subscription services due to imprecise plain ID selection.
